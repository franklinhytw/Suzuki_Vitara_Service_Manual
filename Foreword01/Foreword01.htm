Service on and around the air bag system components or wiring must be performed only by an authorized SUZUKI dealer. Refer to “Air Bag System Components and Wiring Location View” under “General Description” in air bag system section in order to confirm whether you are performing service on or near the air bag system components or wiring. Please observe all WARNINGS and “Service Precautions” under “On-Vehicle Service” in air bag system section before performing service on or around the air bag system components or wiring. Failure to follow WARNINGS could result in unintentional activation of the system or could render the system inoperative. Either of these two conditions may result in severe injury.

If the air bag system and another vehicle system both need repair, Suzuki recommends that the air bag system be repaired first, to help avoid unintended air bag system activation.

Do not modify the steering wheel, instrument panel or any other air bag system component on or around air bag system components or wiring. Modifications can adversely affect air bag system performance and lead to injury.

If the vehicle will be exposed to temperatures over 93 °C (200 °F ), for example, during a paint baking process, remove the air bag system components, that is air bag or inflator modules, SDM and/or seat belt with pretensioner, beforehand to avoid component damage or unintended activation.
