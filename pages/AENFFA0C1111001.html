<div class="ptxt">An automobile engine is a combination of many machined, honed, polished and lapped surfaces with tolerances that are of the order of thousands of a millimeter (ten thousandths of an inch).</div>
<div class="ptxt">Accordingly, when any internal engine parts are serviced, cleanliness and care are important.</div>
<div class="ptxt">It should be understood that proper cleaning and protection of machined surfaces and friction areas is part of the repair procedure. This is considered standard shop practice even if not specifically stated.</div>
<div class="list">
<span class="listnum">•</span>A liberal coating of engine oil should be applied to friction areas during assembly to protect and lubricate the surfaces on initial operation.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Whenever valve train components, pistons, piston rings, connecting rods, rod bearings, and crankshaft journal bearings are removed for service, they should be retained in order.<br>At the time of installation, they should be installed in the original locations and with the same mating surfaces as when removed.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Battery cables should be disconnected before any major work is performed on the engine.<br>Failure to disconnect cables may result in damage to wire harness or other electrical parts.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>The four cylinders of the engine are identified by numbers; No.1, No.2, No.3 and No.4 counted from crankshaft pulley side to flywheel side.<br>
