<div class="ptxt">Service operation of any type performed on the fuel system involves a risk of fire and personal injury if proper precautions are not taken.</div>
<div class="ptxt">Take the following precautions whenever working on the fuel system.</div>
<div class="list">
<span class="listnum">•</span>Disconnect the negative (–) cable at the battery.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Do not smoke. Put up no smoking signs around the work area.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Have CO<sub class="sub">2</sub> fire extinguishers handy.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Perform service operations only in a well-ventilated area away from any open flames such as gas water heaters.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Wear safety glasses.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Remove the fuel filler cap from the fuel filler neck to relieve the fuel tank of fuel vapor pressure, and then reinstall the cap.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Before loosening or disconnecting the fuel feed line, relieve the fuel system of fuel pressure by following <a href="javascript:%20xref(&#39;AENFFA0C1736002&#39;)">Fuel Pressure Relief Procedure:D16AA</a>.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>When disconnecting a fitting on the fuel line, cover the fitting with a shop cloth to soak up the small amount of fuel that may flow out from the disconnected fuel line. Put the used cloth in an approved container.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Never run the engine with the fuel pump relay disconnected when the engine and exhaust system are hot.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Since fuel hose connections vary with the pipe type, connect and clamp each hose using the correct method for each specific connection. <a class="titleoff" href="javascript:%20xref(&#39;AENFFA0C1736001&#39;)"><img src="../icon/intxreftitleoff.png" alt="icon">&nbsp;</a><br>After connecting a hose, check that there is no twist or kink in the hose.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>When installing an injector or a fuel feed pipe, lubricate its O-rings with fuel.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Do not set ignition “ON” with disconnecting fuel pipe and/or removing fuel system components.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Handle the fuel tank carefully. Do not allow it to touch sharp edges or hot surfaces. Do not drop it. If the tank is dropped, the tank and all components on and in it should be replaced because they may have been damaged.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>When any pit and/or crack is found in fuel tank, never repair the tank but always replace it with a new fuel tank.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>As fuel tank is made of plastic, when solvent such as grease and sealant is allowed to contact fuel tank, some chemical reaction may occur, causing fuel tank to be swollen, hardened or deformed, resulting in fuel leakage from fuel tank.<br>Do not allow solvent such as grease or sealant to contact fuel tank. In addition, wipe off any solvent such as grease or sealant when it contacts tank, without delay.<br>
