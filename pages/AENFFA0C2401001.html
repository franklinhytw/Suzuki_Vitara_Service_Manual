<span class="listnum">•</span>Tire inflation pressure should be checked when tires are cool.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>The tire inflation pressure will change due to changes in atmospheric pressure, temperature or tire temperature when driving. To reduce the chance that the low tire pressure warning light will come on due to normal changes in temperature and atmospheric pressure, it is important to check and adjust the tire pressures when the tires are cold. Tires that appear to be at the specified pressure when checked after driving, when the tires are warm, could have pressure below the specification when the tires cool down. Also, tires that are inflated to the specified pressure in a warm garage may have pressure below the specification when the vehicle is driven outside in very cold temperature. If you adjust the tire pressure in a garage that is warmer than the outside air temperature, you should add 1 psi to the recommended cold tire inflation pressure for every 5.6 °C (10 °F) difference between garage temperature and outside air temperature.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Specified tire inflation pressure should be found on “Tire Placard” or in Owner’s Manual.<br>

<div class="ptxt">The tires are of tubeless type. The tires are designed to operate satisfactorily with loads up to the full rated load capacity when inflated to the recommended inflation pressure.</div>
<div class="ptxt">Correct tire pressures and driving habits have an important influence on tire life. Heavy cornering, excessively rapid acceleration and unnecessary sharp braking increase tire wear.</div>
