<div class="ptxt">The oil pump is of a trochoid type, installed in the timing chain cover and is driven by the crankshaft.</div>
<div class="ptxt">Oil is drawn up through the oil pump strainer and passes through the pump to the oil filter. The filtered oil flows into an oil cooler at the upper part and then to the main oil gallery in the cylinder block. Oil passing through the oil cooler is cooled by flowing coolant from water jacket in the cylinder block to the cylinder head. Oil from the main gallery is supplied to the crankshaft main bearings and cylinder head. An oil passage is connected to the sub gallery via crankshaft main bearing portion. The following devices are lubricated or pressurized by delivered oil as follows.</div>
<div class="list">
<span class="listnum">•</span>Crankshaft journal<br>Main bearings supporting crankshaft journals are lubricated and the oil is supplied to the connecting rod bearings by means of intersecting passages drilled in the crankshaft, and then splashed from the big end of each connecting rod to lubricate cylinder wall, piston pin, piston and piston rings.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Timing chain oil jet<br>Oil from an oil passage between the main gallery and main bearing is supplied to the jet and injected for lubrication of the timing chain, timing sprockets, timing chain tensioner and timing chain guide.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Piston cooling jet<br>Oil from the sub oil gallery is injected through the jet to each piston for additional piston cooling.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Tensioner adjuster<br>Oil from an oil passage connected to the main bearing provides pressure to the tensioner adjuster for adjustment of the chain tension.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Cylinder head<br>Oil from the main gallery is supplied to OCV through the timing chain cover and the rest of oil goes up to camshaft front lower housing and then divided into passages drilled in the cylinder head at intake side and exhaust side independently.<br>
<div class="list">
<span class="listnum">—</span>Intake VVT actuator<br>Oil is supplied through the timing chain cover, OCV, cylinder head, camshaft front lower housing, camshaft front upper housing and intake camshaft for the camshaft timing control.<br><span class="listnum">—</span>Camshaft journal<br>Oil is supplied through the passages in the cylinder head at intake side and exhaust side except intake No.1. Intake No.1 journal is lubricated by oil from OCV through passages in camshaft front upper housing.<br><span class="listnum">—</span>Hydraulic lash adjuster<br>Through the same passages for the camshaft journals, oil is supplied. From top of each hydraulic lash adjuster, oil is injected to the valve rocker arm according to the stroke.<br><span class="listnum">—</span>Valve rocker arm and cam surface<br>Splashed oil from top of the hydraulic lash adjuster through the valve rocker arm lubricates the valve rocker arm including its roller bearing and corresponding cam surface.<br><span class="listnum">—</span>High pressure fuel pump, tappet, roller and cam<br>Oil is injected through a small hole drilled in camshaft intake rear housing to the high pressure fuel pump, tappet, roller and cam.<br><span class="listnum">—</span>Vacuum pump<br>Oil is supplied from intake side oil passage in the cylinder head passing through the thermostat case.<br>
</div>
<span class="listnum">•</span>Turbocharger<br>Oil is supplied through a turbocharger oil feed pipe connected to the main gallery by an oil union bolt providing mesh filter.<br>The oil pump is equipped with an oil relief valve. This valve relieves oil pressure when the pressure exceeds specified value.<br>The oil filter provides a relief valve to bypass oil when oil pressure exceeds the filter’s specification caused by clogging of the filter element due to poor maintenance (without changing the filter as scheduled). In this situation, dusty oil will circulate in the engine without filtration and causes the engine damage.<br>
