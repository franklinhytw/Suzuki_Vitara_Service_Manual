<div class="ptxt">When servicing the steering column, it is important that only the specified fasteners are used and they are tightened exactly to specified torque to keep the collapsible steering column and other features fully workable. It is also important to carefully handle the steering column during and after its removal from the vehicle, such as preventing the use of a steering wheel puller and avoiding hammering the end of the steering shaft, leaning the removed steering column assembly against the wall or any other object, or dropping the assembly. These precautions should be observed to prevent the capsules that keep the designed length and position of the steering column from being loosened.</div>
