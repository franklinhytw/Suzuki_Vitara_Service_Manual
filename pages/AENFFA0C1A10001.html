<div class="list">
<span class="listnum">•</span>Never expose the battery to an open flame or electric spark. A battery generates highly flammable and explosive hydrogen gas.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Battery fluid is a corrosive acid. Do not allow it to contact eyes, skin, fabrics or painted surfaces of the vehicle. If the fluid contacts any of them, immediately and thoroughly flush the affected area with a large quantity of water.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Keep the battery out of reach of children.<br>

<span class="s1num">1)</span>The battery is a very reliable component, but needs periodical attentions.
<div class="list">
<span class="listnum">•</span>Keep battery carrier clean.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Prevent rust formation on the terminal posts.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Keep electrolyte up to upper level uniformly in all cells (If cell caps are equipped).<br><span class="listnum">•</span>When keeping battery on vehicle over a long period, follow instructions given below.<br>
<div class="list">
<span class="listnum">—</span>Weekly, start the engine and run it until it reaches normal operating temperature with engine speed of 2,000 to 3,000 rpm. Check that all electric switches are turned off before storing the vehicle.<br><span class="listnum">—</span>Recharge the battery twice a month to prevent it from discharging excessively. This is especially important when ambient temperature is low.<br>The battery discharges even when it is not used, while vehicles are stored. Battery electrolyte can freeze and battery case can crack in cold ambient condition if the battery is not properly charged.<br>

<div class="s1">
<span class="s1num">2)</span>Keep the battery cable connections clean.<br>The cable connections, particularly at the positive (+) terminal post, tend to corrode. The corrosion or rust on the mating faces of conductors resists the flow of current.<br>Clean the terminals and fittings periodically to ensure good metal-to-metal contact, and grease the connections after each cleaning to protect them against rusting.</div>
<div class="s1">
<span class="s1num">3)</span>Periodically check the state of charge of battery. The simplest way to tell the state of charge is to carry out a hydrometer test. The hydrometer is an instrument for measuring the specific gravity of the battery electrolyte. The specific gravity of the electrolyte is indicative of the state of charge. <a class="titleoff" href="javascript:%20xref(&#39;AENFFA0C1A14001&#39;)"><img src="../icon/intxreftitleoff.png" alt="icon">&nbsp;</a>
