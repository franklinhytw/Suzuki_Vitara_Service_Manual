<div class="ptxt">The battery has three major functions in the electrical system.</div>
<div class="ptxt">Electric load current sensor incorporating battery temperature sensor (if equipped) is fitted on the battery negative (–) terminal. (For more information on these sensors, refer to <a href="javascript:%20xref(&#39;AENFFA0CA901002&#39;)">Description of ENG A-STOP System Components</a>.)</div>
<div class="list">
<span class="listnum">•</span>It is a source of electrical energy for cranking the engine.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>It acts as a voltage stabilizer for the electrical system.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>It can, for a limited time, provide energy when the electrical load exceeds the output of generator.<br>

<div class="servinfosub" id="AENFFA0C1A11001001">
<div class="title">Carrier and Hold-Down Clamp</div>
<div class="ptxt">The battery carrier should be in good condition so that it supports the battery securely and keeps it level. Before installing battery, check that the battery carrier and hold-down clamp are clean and free from corrosion and that there is no foreign material in the carrier.</div>
<div class="ptxt">To prevent battery from shaking in its carrier, the hold-down clamp bolts should be tightened enough but not over-tightened.</div>
</div>
<div class="servinfosub" id="AENFFA0C1A11001002">
<div class="title">Electrolyte Freezing</div>
<div class="ptxt">The freezing point of electrolyte depends on its specific gravity. Since freezing may ruin a battery, it should be protected against freezing by keeping it in a fully charged condition. If the battery freezes accidentally, it should not be charged until it will unfreeze.</div>
</div>
<div class="servinfosub" id="AENFFA0C1A11001003">
<div class="title">Sulfation</div>
<div class="ptxt">If battery is left for a long period in discharged condition, the lead sulfate becomes converted into a hard, crystalline substance, which will not easily turn back to the active material again during the subsequent recharging. “Sulfation” means the result as well as the process of that reaction. Such a battery can be revived by very slow charging and may be restored to usable condition but its capacity will be lower than before.</div>
