<span class="listnum">•</span>Vehicle dynamics synthetic control is a system for inhibiting vehicle skidding during cornering. This system totally controls EPS and 4WD systems prior to activation of ESP<sup class="sup">®</sup> control, which is activated based on vehicle driving conditions judged by BCM.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>BCM calculates a driver’s target yaw rate, the target vehicle cornering speed based on the vehicle speed and the steering angle signal. It detects the degree of oversteering/understeering during cornering based on the signal difference between the target yaw rate and the actual one, and it inhibits oversteering/understeering and assists in stabilizing the vehicle. Furthermore, if the vehicle is judged to be unsteady, severe oversteering/understeering, to the degree it cannot be controlled with vehicle dynamics synthetic control, the vehicle is switched to ESP<sup class="sup">®</sup> control.<br>

<div class="title">Example: Oversteering Restraint Control</div>
<div class="ptxt">When vehicle rear wheels slide out during cornering, the actual yaw rate is higher than the target. BCM judges that oversteering, tendency for rear wheels to skid, has occurred and the following vehicle dynamics synthetic control is carried out.</div>
<div class="ptxt">BCM sends steering assist torque request to P/S control module based on oversteering level via CAN communication, and this facilitates decrease in excessive steering input by providing counter-steering assist torque to steering system. Also, on 4WD model, BCM sends 4WD coupling torque request to 4WD control module via CAN communication. This reduces the rear wheel traction torque and reduces the influence of traction force at the rear wheels, and this helps prevent oversteering.</div>
