<div class="ptxt">When repairing Automatic Transaxle (A/T), it is necessary to conduct the on-vehicle test to investigate where the cause of the trouble lies first.</div>
<div class="ptxt">Then whether overhaul should be done or not is determined. If the transaxle is disassembled without such preliminary procedure, not only the cause of the trouble would be unknown, but also a secondary trouble may occur and unexpectedly longer time would be wasted.</div>
<div class="ptxt">As the A/T consists of high precision component, the following cautions should be strictly observed when handling its parts in disassembly and reassembly.</div>
<div class="list">
<span class="listnum">•</span>Disassembly of valve body assembly is prohibited. If the valve body or each solenoid is found to be faulty, replace the entire assembly.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Disassembly of forward clutch, direct clutch or reverse clutch is prohibited.<br>If the stroking test result is out of the specified value, replace the clutch as an assembly.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Wash dirt off from the transaxle so that no such dirt will enter the transaxle during dismounting and remounting.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>When overhauling, select a clean place free from dust and dirt.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Place a rubber mat on a workbench to protect parts from damage.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>When wiping internal parts of A/T, use lint-free paper, not cloth or rags.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>When separating the case joint, do not pry with a flat-bladed screwdriver or the like, but tap with a plastic hammer lightly.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Wash the disassembled parts in Automatic Transaxle Fluid (ATF) or kerosene (using care not to allow ATF or kerosene to get on your face, etc.) and check that each fluid passage is not clogged by blowing air into it. But use kerosene to wash the discs, resin washers and rubber parts.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Replace each gasket, oil seal and O-ring with a new one.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Apply ATF to sliding or rotating parts before reassembly.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Keep component parts in group for each subassembly and avoid mixing them up.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Clean all parts with cleaning solvent thoroughly and air-dry them.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Keep face and eyes away from solvent spray while air blowing parts.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Check mating surface for irregularities and remove them, if any, and clean it again.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Apply ATF to all O-rings.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>When installing seal ring, be careful so that it is not expanded excessively, extruded or caught.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Replace oil seals that are removed and apply grease to their lips.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Always use torque wrench when tightening bolts.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>A set of new discs and a new band brake should be soaked in ATF at least 2 hours before use.<br>
