Put the used cloth in an approved container.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Never run the engine with the fuel pump relay disconnected when the engine and exhaust system are hot.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Since fuel hose connections vary with the pipe type, connect and clamp each hose using the correct method for each specific connection. <a class="titleoff" href="javascript:%20xref(&#39;AENFFA0C1716002&#39;)"><img src="../icon/intxreftitleoff.png" alt="icon">&nbsp;</a><br>After connecting a hose, check that there is no twist or kink in the hose.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>When installing a fuel injector or a fuel feed pipe, lubricate its O-rings with gasoline.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Handle the fuel tank carefully. Do not allow it to touch sharp edges or hot surfaces. Do not drop it. If the tank is dropped, the tank and all components on and in it should be replaced because they may have been damaged.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>When any pit and/or crack is found in fuel tank, never repair the tank but always replace it with a new fuel tank.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>As fuel tank is made of plastic, when solvent such as grease and sealant is allowed to contact fuel tank, some chemical reaction may occur, causing fuel tank to be swollen, hardened or deformed, resulting in fuel leakage from fuel tank.<br>Do not allow solvent such as grease or sealant to contact fuel tank. In addition, wipe off any solvent such as grease or sealant when it contacts tank, without delay.<br>
