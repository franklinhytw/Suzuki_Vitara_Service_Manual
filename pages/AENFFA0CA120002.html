<span class="listnum">•</span>Adaptive cruise control system will not supplement lack of driving skills or reckless driving.<br>While driving with this system, do not overestimate the system’s abilities and pay enough attention to ambient traffic and road conditions, weather, etc.<br><span class="listnum">•</span>Failure to take the following precautions may cause unexpected accident.<br>
<div class="list">
<span class="listnum">—</span>When a vehicle ahead is getting closer extremely or a vehicle cuts in, maintain safety distance between two vehicles without having too much confidence in the adaptive cruise control system, operating brakes and avoid rear-end collision.<br><span class="listnum">—</span>If the vehicle ahead disappears while the adaptive cruise control system is functioning, your vehicle will be accelerated automatically up to the set speed. Therefore, it is necessary to cancel the control in the system before leaving main lane of the highway.<br><span class="listnum">—</span>The adaptive cruise control system does not respond to a parking vehicle or a very slow running vehicle. Therefore, secure safety against the pressing hazard paying enough attention to road conditions and operating brakes.<br><span class="listnum">—</span>If the road shape repeats steep uphill and downhill, the system may fail to pick up a running vehicle ahead and it comes closer. In this situation, it is necessary to apply brakes.<br>
</div>
<span class="listnum">•</span>Failure to observe the following precautions will cause malfunction of adaptive cruise control system resulting in a serious accident.<br>
<div class="list">
<span class="listnum">—</span>Do not affix sticker including clear film over the millimeter wave radar cover located in front of the RBS control module.<br><span class="listnum">—</span>Do not drop or otherwise expose the RBS control module to large shock. The RBS control module that has received large shock should be replaced.<br><span class="listnum">—</span>If peripheral component of the radiator grill is damaged, check the RBS control module and its bracket.<br><span class="listnum">—</span>When replacing the radiator grill and millimeter wave radar cover, use SUZUKI genuine parts.<br><span class="listnum">—</span>Do not modify the suspension. Modification of the vehicle’s height or inclination may affect to pick up a running vehicle ahead correctly.<br>

<div class="note">NOTE:
<div style="margin-left:16px;">
<div class="list">
<span class="listnum">•</span>The adaptive cruise control system functions detecting reflective radio wave from rear end of the vehicle ahead, therefore the system may not work under the following conditions.<br>
<div class="list">
<span class="listnum">—</span>A vehicle ahead or a vehicle on the neighboring lane is running raising rainwater or snow dust.<br><span class="listnum">—</span>A vehicle ahead has extremely small rear end area such as an unloaded trailer.<br><span class="listnum">—</span>Your vehicle is tilted caused by heavy loading on the luggage compartment or rear seat.<br>
</div>
</div>
<div class="list">
<span class="listnum">•</span>Even when distance is short between two vehicles, headway alert may not work under the following conditions.<br>
<div class="list">
<span class="listnum">—</span>Your vehicle is running at 160 km/h (99 mile/h) or higher speed.<br><span class="listnum">—</span>Relative speed to a vehicle ahead is small, i.e. two vehicles are running almost at the same speed.<br><span class="listnum">—</span>A vehicle ahead is running faster, i.e. the vehicle ahead is going farther gradually.<br><span class="listnum">—</span>Right after setting up the desired speed.<br><span class="listnum">—</span>While depressing the accelerator pedal or right after releasing the pedal.<br>
</div>
</div>
<div class="list">
<span class="listnum">•</span>When the millimeter wave radar cover is heavily covered by raindrops or snow, the system may not detect the correct distance to the vehicle ahead.<br>
</div>
<div class="list">
<span class="listnum">•</span>The millimeter wave radar detects soil on the radar surface and informs this situation to the driver.<br>While the soil is being detected, adaptive cruise control system is canceled automatically.<br>However, it may not be detected even if the surface is soiled depending on the conditions.<br>Therefore, it is necessary to keep millimeter wave radar and millimeter wave radar cover always clean.<br>
</div>
<div class="list">
<span class="listnum">•</span>Extent of detecting area by the millimeter wave radar is narrow at nearby area in front of your vehicle and distance to the vehicle ahead cannot be maintained properly due to delay in detecting motorcycle running on the edge of your lane or vehicle closely cutting in.<br>
</div>
<div class="list">
<span class="listnum">•</span>Because of the road conditions such as winding road, getting in or getting out of a corner, inside of tunnel, narrow traffic lane due to road repairing or traffic restriction, or the vehicle conditions such as steering operation, vehicle position in the lane, unstable vehicle running due to vehicle damage caused by accident, your vehicle is controlled temporarily detecting a vehicle on neighboring lane or peripheral things, or warning is activated. In this situation, affected by the poor detecting condition, your vehicle may come near the vehicle ahead accidentally.<br>
